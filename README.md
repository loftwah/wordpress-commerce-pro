# WordPress Commerce Pro

WordPress Commerce Pro is a course that will teach you how to build a successful e-commerce store using WordPress. I will try to be vendor agnostic but in this example I will be using namecheap, Cloudflare and DigitalOcean. I will cover both options for those who are happy to dive into their terminal and for those who don't. I can't promise there will be completely free options for what we're doing but I will try to keep accessibility in mind as the content for this course grows.

I haven't decided on exactly what kind of content will be covered here, but it will be freely accesible until it isn't. I'm not going to pretend this isn't for some extra money on the side, but I do promise to give this my all and provide good quality content that you can actually learn from and that I do actually know what I am talking about, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and when this isn't free there will be a full re-fund period with no questions asked.

## Think of a name and register a domain name with namecheap

I will be using wpcommercepro85 as the name for a lot of my examples, so you can just replace it with whatever name you are using. If you don't have one and can't think of one you can generate something [here](https://codepen.io/rstacruz/full/wJyaJb/).
