# WordPress Commerce Pro

WordPress Commerce Pro is a course that will teach you how to build a successful e-commerce store using WordPress. I will try to be vendor agnostic but in this example I will be using namecheap, Cloudflare and DigitalOcean. I will cover both options for those who are happy to dive into their terminal and for those who don't. I can't promise there will be completely free options for what we're doing but I will try to keep accessibility in mind as the content for this course grows.

I haven't decided on exactly what kind of content will be covered here, but it will be freely accesible until it isn't. I'm not going to pretend this isn't for some extra money on the side, but I do promise to give this my all and provide good quality content that you can actually learn from and that I do actually know what I am talking about, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and when this isn't free there will be a full re-fund period with no questions asked.

For an example of something similar to what we are going to be doing, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8vUTOXhCdw).

I blame [DorianDevelops](https://www.youtube.com/c/DorianDevelops) and [Jeff Geerling](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg) for keeping me so motived. They are great people worth watching on YouTube.

## I am using GMail for my examples so I will create an account

These are the steps to create a Google account if you haven't seen it already or don't have one. We will be creating a new account for our business.

Fill out the required details and click the button to create your account.

## Think of a name and register a domain name with namecheap

[Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) | [GMail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox) | [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I will be using wpcommercepro85 as the name for a lot of my examples, so you can just replace it with whatever name you are using. If you don't have one and can't think of one you can generate something [here](https://codepen.io/rstacruz/full/wJyaJb/).

In your web browser, go to [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) and sign up for a new account if you don't already have one.

The sign up process should look something like this:

Within namecheap you are able to search for domains that you can purchace. Search for the domain that you would like to use and follow the typical steps to purchase it.

![namecheap](static/namecheap-search.png)

I am searching for and buying the domain wpcommerce.pro.

![namecheap](static/namecheap-buy-domain.png)

Fill out the form and click the purchase button.

We will be configuring our namecheap domain name servers to use our own DNS (Domain Name System) servers, which will be provided by Cloudflare.

## Set up the infrastructure needed to host your store with DigitalOcean

If you don't already have an account, please sign up with [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)

![digitalocean](static/digitalocean-signup.png)

You will need a method of payment for this one and the options are card or PayPal.

![digitalocean](static/digitalocean-signup-2.png)

Click through the initial welcome screen and you'll find yourself at the DigitalOcean dashboard. You can change the settings of your project so the naming is more suitable for whatever project you are working on, in my example I will use wpcommercepro85.

## Set up DNS Cloudflare to connect your domain name to your server

Create an account with Cloudflare if you don't already have one.

![cloudflare](static/cloudflare-3.png)

When you're logged into Cloudflare, add a new site and choose the free plan. You will be able to add a domain name to your site and get the details required for configuring it within namecheap's DNS management console.

## Install and set up WordPress on your server

Now, because I have been busy and not able to come back to this for nearly a month, I have found the domain is suspended and I have to go through the support process to get it all back. This is actually kind of cool because it is a very real scenario that you will probably face sometime.
